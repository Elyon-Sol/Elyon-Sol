"""
Target-side admissibility-envelope verifier for Elyon-Sol.

Built at VL-037 per docs/restructure/08_enforcement_design.md section 8
step 1 (the delivery-agnostic, target-side verifier). This is the first
G4 (non-bypassable enforcement) build increment. It wires nothing into
pep.py; delivery (attaching an envelope to a call so a target actually
receives it) is VL-038's domain (artifact 08 section 8 step 2). Verifier
first, delivery later, mirrors the CCS sequencing (VL-025 built
envelope.py with no caller; VL-029 wired pep.py to it).

==============================================================
What this module does
==============================================================

verify_envelope(envelope, interaction, target_url) decides whether a
target should honor an admissibility envelope for the interaction it is
about to act on. It returns {"accepted": bool, "reason": str} and does
two things, in order:

  1. Currency + integrity, via envelope.reassert(). The envelope's
     pinned state hashes (canon, evaluator, manifest) must still match
     live state, and decision_sha256 must verify. Any reassert() outcome
     other than REASSERTED rejects. This closes forgery / tamper
     (adversary A2) and detects state transitions (canon section 12.1 /
     12.4); reassert() Row 2 returns INVALIDATED on a decision_sha256
     mismatch (a fabricated or mutated envelope).
  2. Interaction binding. The envelope's request_context (AP, OP,
     context, expected_manifest_version, expected_manifest_sha256) and
     its target_url must match the live interaction and target_url. A
     genuine, current envelope for interaction X presented against a
     different interaction Y reassert()s REASSERTED (no state
     transition) but is rejected here. This closes same-state replay
     (adversary A3), which reassert() alone does NOT close because
     reassert() compares repository-state hashes and never compares
     request_context against a live interaction (artifact 08 sections
     4.2 and 7).

Canon basis: section 13 ("Eligibility does not persist across state
transitions without revalidation") is the revalidation that reassert()
performs; the binding check operationalizes section 13's coverage of
the exact interaction and the section 11.1 interaction identity
I = (A, S, C, t). No new canonical invariant is introduced: this is an
application of existing constructs (artifact 08 section 5).

==============================================================
What this module does NOT do (canon section 14)
==============================================================

The verifier is non-executing: it computes an accept / reject decision
and performs no action and no I/O beyond reassert()'s file reads. It
does not replace an identity system; it is identity-agnostic. It is
target-side code a target runs by its own policy; it is not the gate.

==============================================================
Deployment precondition: G5 (durable published hash source)
==============================================================

reassert() reads its comparison hashes from LOCAL disk
(CANON/canon.lock, IMPLEMENTATION/evaluator.py, the live manifest).
That is valid for this in-repo, co-located build and its tests. A real
target on a different host needs an authentic, current, PUBLISHED
source for those hashes; that durable source is gap G5 (artifact 08
section 6, Decision E1). G5 is NAMED here as the deployment
precondition and is NOT built in this module.

The A1 adversary (a caller that never routes through the gate) is
closeable only by a target-side policy that refuses un-attested calls,
not by this verifier (artifact 08 section 4.4). Every mechanism here is
therefore necessary-but-not-sufficient for full non-bypassability: it
makes routed calls verifiable and forge / replay resistant, while A1
remains a separate, target-policy sub-problem.

==============================================================
Normalization parity
==============================================================

Canon section 11.5 / 11.6 define AP and OP as sets, so the binding
check compares them as sets. The verifier normalizes BOTH sides with
the same rule the PEP applied (request_validator._normalize_set_field:
sorted(set(...))) before comparing: the live interaction's AP / OP and
the envelope's recorded AP / OP. In production build_envelope records
the already-PEP-normalized lists, so the envelope side is already
sorted/deduped; normalizing it again is a no-op there but keeps the
comparison correct for a target-side verifier handling envelopes it did
not construct, and a caller passing an unsorted or duplicated AP / OP
does not cause a false reject. context is compared by canonical_json
equality (reusing envelope.canonical_json) for consistency with the
envelope's hashing discipline; target_url and the manifest-pinning
fields are compared by string equality.

The context-equality choice is an [INFERENCE] (artifact 08 gap
candidate 1: artifact 08 does not pin equality semantics for the
free-form canon section 11.1 C). canonical_json equality is the chosen
default; for two dict values it is behaviorally equivalent to Python
value equality, and it stays consistent with the decision_sha256
canonicalization. A later spec edit may pin this explicitly.

            (adversary A1) or fabricated a non-envelope.

            returns (AP, OP, context, expected_manifest_version,

            the verifier normalizes them before comparison.
        target_url: The live target_url the interaction is addressed to.
        record_source: Optional fetched published record (VL-039
            cross-host); None uses local-disk currency (unchanged default).
        pinned_public_keys: Optional {key_id: public_key} map (VL-040).
            When supplied, the issuer signature is REQUIRED and verified
            fail-closed (REF_VERIFY_SIGNATURE_INVALID /

            (default) is the unsigned path, byte-behavior-unchanged.
        key_record_view: Optional validated B-prime-2 trust view (VL-042)
            from key_record_source.load_key_record_from_bytes, shape
            {key_id: {"public_key", "revoked", "not_before", "not_after"}}.
            When supplied it is the SOLE issuer-key trust source (record-
            exclusive, decision 3); pinned_public_keys is ignored. The issuer
            key_id must be present, not revoked, and in-window
            (REF_VERIFY_KEY_UNKNOWN / _REVOKED / _OUT_OF_WINDOW) before the
            signature is verified against the record-sourced key. Appended last
            to preserve positional-call compatibility.

    Returns:
        {"accepted": bool, "reason": str}. On accept, reason is
        ACCEPT_REASSERTED_AND_BOUND. On reject, reason is one of the

           also guards reassert()'s key accesses so a malformed envelope
           rejects cleanly rather than raising.

           REF_VERIFY_REASSERT_INVALIDATED; RE-EVALUATE-REQUIRED ->
           REF_VERIFY_REASSERT_RE_EVALUATE_REQUIRED.
        3. Interaction binding. Any request_context or target_url
           mismatch -> REF_VERIFY_BINDING_MISMATCH.
        4. Accept.
