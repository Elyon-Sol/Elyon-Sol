Reference downstream enforcing target for Elyon-Sol
(docs/restructure/12_g5_transport_design.md step 4).

This is the standalone, deployable enforcing target that supersedes the
8-line IMPLEMENTATION/target.py stub. It promotes the embedded scaffolding -
the TARGET_DRIVER subprocess string in
EVIDENCE/proofs/g5_signed_cross_host_001_runner.py and the in-process
_build_cross_host_target_app / build_enforcing_target_app helpers in
TESTS/adversarial/test_cross_host.py and TESTS/adversarial/test_enforcement.py -
into one real service a deployer can run and an external attacker can point at.

==============================================================
What it does (the reference policy)
==============================================================

On every POST to /target the target, by its OWN policy, decides whether to
honor or refuse the call:

  1. Resolve out-of-band configuration (never from the repo): the URL this
     target serves (for the binding check), the publisher URL, the pinned
     published-record anchor, and the pinned gate signing public key.
     Incomplete / malformed configuration FAILS CLOSED
     (REF_TARGET_NOT_CONFIGURED) - the target refuses rather than act on an
     unconfigured trust base, the same per-request fail-closed posture pep.py
     takes when no signing key is configured.
  2. Read the X-Elyon-Sol-Envelope attestation header (absent / unparseable
     -> treated as no envelope). A direct, un-attested caller (adversary A1)
     therefore reaches step 4 with envelope=None and is refused there
     (REF_VERIFY_ENVELOPE_ABSENT). A1 is closed by THIS target's policy of
     requiring a valid attestation, NOT by the gate (verifier.py lines 67-72;
     artifact 08 section 4.4; artifact 12 step 4).
  3. Fetch the published record from the publisher and anchor-verify it
     against the pinned root (published_source.fetch_published_record). A
     transport failure, a non-200, or a record whose bytes do not hash to the
     pinned anchor returns None -> refuse (REF_TARGET_ANCHOR_MISMATCH) before
     any envelope currency claim is trusted (fail-closed, canon section 9).
  4. Call verifier.verify_envelope(envelope, interaction, target_url,
     record_source=<fetched record>, pinned_public_keys=<pinned gate key>).
     Because a pinned key is supplied, the issuer signature is REQUIRED and
     verified fail-closed BEFORE currency (the signed path; the production gate
     signs every default forward per VL-047). Currency is checked against the
     FETCHED record, not local disk (Decision C / D-b; VL-039). The interaction
     binding (request_context + target_url) closes same-state replay (A3).
     Honor (200, act) iff verify_envelope accepts; otherwise refuse (403) and
     do not act.

==============================================================
Reference policy, NOT authored-to-pass (the finish-line-(B) requirement)
==============================================================

The acceptance criterion is exactly "verify_envelope accepts against the
anchor-verified fetched record AND the pinned gate signature verifies." It is
not tuned to any author happy-path test vector: the target consults only its
out-of-band pins and the production verifier. This is the load-bearing property
for finish line (B) - a target an EXTERNAL attacker can point at must not be
calibrated to the author's vectors (artifact 12 sections 2, 4). Per GR-3, any
attack run in-loop against this target is characterization, not certification;
G5 CLOSED requires the external attacker (artifact 12 section 1).

==============================================================
No new canonical invariant (canon section 14)
==============================================================

The target verifies and acts or refuses; it does not decide admissibility and
it does not execute the gate's logic. Fetching a record and verifying an
envelope are verification I/O - the same posture published_source.py and
verifier.py already hold (artifact 08 section 5; transport.py header).

==============================================================
Out-of-band configuration (custody parallel to pep._get_signing_key and
transport.py's ELYON_TLS_* and the published-record anchor)
==============================================================

Resolved from the environment, never from the repo:

  ELYON_TARGET_URL          - the URL this target serves; the envelope's
                              target_url must equal it (binding).
  ELYON_PUBLISHER_URL       - where the published record is fetched.
  ELYON_PINNED_ROOT_SHA256  - the out-of-band published-record anchor (sha256
                              of the authentic published-record bytes),
                              distributed out-of-band, NEVER fetched alongside
                              the record (that would be circular;
                              published_source.py header lines 22-27).
  ELYON_GATE_KEY_ID         - the pinned gate signing key id.
  ELYON_GATE_PUBLIC_KEY_HEX - the pinned gate signing public key, raw Ed25519
                              public bytes as hex.

Secure distribution of the anchor and the public-key pin is itself the named G5
floor (Decision F; external_verification_readiness gate 5): acknowledged, not
defended here.

Build-then-wire (the project discipline since VL-025): this module adds a real
service with NO change to the gate's default path. pep.py does not import it;
the gate only POSTs to a target_url. Wiring the two-node harness to run THIS
target as node B (replacing the stub) is artifact 12 step 2.

Deploy:  uvicorn IMPLEMENTATION.reference_target:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000
(with the ELYON_* environment configured out-of-band).

Ledger: VL-061 (T-G5-transport; artifact 12 step 4 reference enforcing target).
