"""
Admissibility envelope construction and reassertion for Elyon-Sol.

Implements docs/restructure/05_admissibility_envelope_spec.md build-order
step 3. This file is the build half of G0 - the canonical CCS
(whitepaper section 12) implementation. The rename half of G0 closed at
VL-012 by renaming `ccs_valid()` to `manifest_integrity_valid()` and
reserving the name "CCS" for this implementation; this file claims that
reservation.

==============================================================
What this module does
==============================================================

Two functions:

- build_envelope(...) constructs a canonical envelope dict matching
  artifact 05's "Envelope structure" section. The envelope records the
  inputs and outputs of a single admissibility decision in a form that
  can be hashed (decision_sha256), persisted, and later re-checked
  against the live repository state.

- reassert(envelope) implements artifact 05's "Reassertion protocol"
  table. Given an envelope, it returns one of three string outcomes
  (REASSERTED, INVALIDATED, RE-EVALUATE-REQUIRED) per the table's five
  rows checked in table order. The function is pure with respect to
  the envelope (reads live file hashes; does not modify the input).

==============================================================
Integration boundary (one-sided per VL-025 opener risk-reduction note)
==============================================================

This module imports from evaluator.py only via manifest_sha256() (the
on-disk MANIFEST/manifest.json hash). It does NOT import the
evaluate() function or the condition functions (ac3_valid, t26_valid,
manifest_integrity_valid). The caller (VL-029's pep.py wiring) is
responsible for calling those condition functions and passing the
resulting booleans into build_envelope() as parameters. This keeps
the integration boundary one-sided and matches receipt.py's pattern
(caller passes decision and condition results in).

This module IS imported by pep.py: VL-029 wired build_envelope() onto
every ELIGIBLE decision, and VL-047 made sign_envelope() the gate's
default forward. It is NOT imported by evaluator.py - the one-sided
boundary above holds (envelope.py reads from evaluator.py, never the
reverse).

==============================================================
Canonicalization discipline
==============================================================

Canonical JSON serialization uses sort_keys=True, separators=(",",":"),
ensure_ascii=True. The ensure_ascii=True choice matches the VL-009
ASCII-safe standard repo-wide and diverges from receipt.py's
canonical_json (which uses ensure_ascii=False; latent inconsistency
surfaced at VL-012's process findings). The divergence is recorded in
the VL-025 ledger entry as a process finding; resolution candidate is
deferred (either update receipt.py to match, or document both
explicitly).

decision_sha256 is computed over the envelope dict minus two fields:

  - decision_sha256 itself (cannot self-hash)
  - timestamp_utc (excluded per artifact 05's timestamp_utc field
    rationale: "excluded from decision_sha256 so the same decision is
    bit-identical regardless of issue time; preserves section 9
    reproducibility")

==============================================================
ccs field on first issuance (artifact 05 open question 1, locked by
VL-025 opener constraint (e))
==============================================================

On first issuance there is no S_t to compare against; only S_{t+1}.
Per artifact 05's first listed proposal and the VL-025 opener's lock
(constraint (e)), condition_results.ccs is recorded as None (Python's
representation of JSON null) on first issuance. The ccs field becomes
a true boolean only at reassertion: per post-VL-026 Edit 5's
forward-looking rule, reassert() in this module performs the
derivation as part of its return value (True on REASSERTED;
False on INVALIDATED or RE-EVALUATE-REQUIRED per canon section
12.4 "if any condition is violated: CCS = 0"). The envelope's
stored condition_results.ccs remains None per the post-VL-026
Edit 2 purity contract; the derivation is in reassert()'s return,
not in the input envelope.
The reassert-time ccs semantic was recorded as a gap candidate in
the VL-025 ledger entry; the spec edit landed at VL-026 (Open
question 1 resolution, Edit 5) and the implementation lands at
VL-029 per Decision A (this commit).

==============================================================
Spec citations
==============================================================

Every field in the returned envelope cites a specific passage of
artifact 05 or of CANON/canon.md. The citation map is recorded in
the VL-025 ledger entry under "Spec-citation map." The reassertion-
table mapping is recorded under "Reassertion-protocol mapping."
