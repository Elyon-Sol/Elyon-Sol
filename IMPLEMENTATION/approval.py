"""
Governance layer - approval grant (Feature 1, increment 1b).

docs/design/governance_layer_design.md section 1.4, with review fixes
[FIX H3] (mandatory grant_id; single-use cannot be skipped), [FIX H4] (bind to
decision_sha256 + approval_request_id), [FIX H5] (separation of duties as a
belt-and-braces approver_key_id != gate_key_id check), and [FIX H7] (freshness
REUSES verifier.not_after_valid, not a re-implementation) folded in.

An "approval grant" is a small signed object a HUMAN (the approver) produces
out-of-band to release a held high-impact decision. It mirrors envelope.py:
the same Ed25519 duck-typed signing/verifying, the same canonical_json
discipline - reusing, not re-implementing, the crypto. The approver identity is
SEPARATE from the gate's issuer identity.

WHAT THIS MODULE DECIDES vs WHAT pep WIRING (1c) DECIDES.
verify_grant() is a PURE function of the grant plus the trust inputs the caller
passes (the expected decision hash, the expected request id, the approver
trust map, the gate key id, the clock). It establishes the grant's
cryptographic provenance, action/request binding, separation of duties, and
freshness. It does NOT consume the grant: SINGLE-USE (claiming grant_id exactly
once via the ReplayCache seam) and the server-side pending-request set are
STATEFUL gate concerns wired in pep.governed_call at increment 1c
([FIX H3]/[FIX H4]); this module only enforces that a grant_id is PRESENT so
the later single-use claim has a non-skippable key. Build-then-wire: NO caller
on the default pep.py path this increment. Canon untouched; the grant lives
above G(I).

    Construct an UNSIGNED approval grant.

    - decision_sha256 ([FIX H4]): the exact decision being approved. Binding to
      decision_sha256 transitively binds target_url, AP, OP, context, and the
      manifest pins (all inside the envelope's hashed region), so an approval of
      action A cannot authorize a different action/args/target B.
    - approval_request_id ([FIX H4]): the id the gate issued with its 202 hold;
      since decision_sha256 is issuance-invariant, request identity is carried
      here (and consumed against the gate's pending set at 1c).
    - grant_id ([FIX H3]): a unique, MANDATORY id; the key the gate claims
      exactly once for single-use. A grant without it is rejected by
      verify_grant - single-use can never be skipped.
    - not_after ([FIX H7]): a tz-AWARE expiry (approval freshness). Naive ->
      ValueError here, mirroring sign_envelope's refusal of a naive not_after.
    - overrides_verdict_id (OPTIONAL): present only on a DOMAIN-OVERRIDE grant.
      It names the `verdict_id` of the authority-signed UNSAFE domain verdict
      this approval overrules. Because sign_grant covers every field but the
      signature, the approver is CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY asserting which safety
      finding they are overruling - not merely approving an opaque decision
      hash. Two consequences downstream:
        * a grant WITHOUT this field cannot satisfy the domain layer, so a
          HIGH_IMPACT approval can never launder a domain verdict requirement;
        * the named verdict's freshness window is waived (and only that one's),
          because human re-determination takes longer than a verdict lives.
      Absent -> an ordinary approval grant, byte-identical to prior revisions.
