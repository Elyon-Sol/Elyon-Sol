Cross-host published-record transport for Elyon-Sol (VL-039, T-G5-transport).

This module is the G5 increment: it lets a target on a different process or
host obtain Elyon-Sol's published hash record from a publisher and verify it
against a single pinned trust anchor, so the target's currency check (the
envelope's pinned canon / evaluator / manifest hashes) can be performed
against the FETCHED record rather than the target's own local disk
(Decision C). It is the cross-host counterpart of the test-scope
published-source reader VL-038 carried inside
TESTS/adversarial/test_enforcement.py; promotion to IMPLEMENTATION/ is the
G5 transport step that VL-038 named, not built (artifact 08 section 6;
04_current_vs_claimed.md G5 row).

==============================================================
The trust bootstrap (Decision B-prime-1: pinned root hash)
==============================================================

G5 does NOT make verification trustless. Trust does not vanish; it
bootstraps. What this buys is reducing and making explicit the trust
surface: from "the target trusts its entire local working tree" down to
"the target trusts ONE pinned published-record anchor, distributed
out-of-band, plus transport integrity." The pinned anchor is the sha256 of
EVIDENCE/published_hashes.json, configured on the target out-of-band (it is
NOT fetched alongside the record - that would be circular). The hash chain
extends: CANON/canon.lock -> EVIDENCE/published_hashes.json -> the pinned
root the target holds.

What remains the G5 FLOOR, named not built (Decision F), parallel to the A1
floor (artifact 08 section 4.4): secure distribution of the pinned anchor
itself; record freshness / revocation (a stale-but-anchor-matching record is
a distinct threat); signing / PKI (which would remove per-target pinning);
TLS and true multi-machine networking (modeled here by loopback). Do not
overclaim "the target needs no trust"; claim "the target's trust is reduced
to one pinned anchor plus the channel."

==============================================================
Canon basis (no new invariant - canon section 14)
==============================================================

Fetching a record is verification I/O. The target still only verifies and
acts / refuses; it does not execute. This operationalizes canon section 11.9
("the manifest must be deterministic, versioned, and integrity-verifiable",
extended to the canon and evaluator hashes), canon section 13 (revalidation),
and canon section 8.2 ("the choice of anchoring system is
implementation-dependent and does not affect admissibility logic" - the
pinned-root anchor is exactly such an implementation-dependent choice). No
new canonical invariant is introduced (artifact 08 section 5).

==============================================================
Separation of concerns
==============================================================

anchor_sha256()          - the pinned-anchor primitive (pure over bytes).
load_record_from_bytes() - anchor-verify then parse (pure over bytes; the
                           load-bearing, network-free trust check; testable
                           deterministically).
fetch_published_record() - the transport: requests.get over loopback, then
                           load_record_from_bytes. The only part that touches
                           the network.

The currency check itself is NOT here: under Decision D-b it lives in
envelope.reassert(envelope, record_source=<fetched record>) and
verifier.verify_envelope(..., record_source=<fetched record>), reused as-is.
This module's job ends at handing back an anchor-verified record dict.
