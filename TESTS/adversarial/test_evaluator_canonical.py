Canon-derived tests for IMPLEMENTATION/evaluator.py (evaluator domain).

Each test cites a specific clause of CANON/canon.md (whitepaper
v0.9.8.4) in its docstring and verifies evaluator.py's behavior
against that clause. This is the evaluator-domain companion to
TESTS/adversarial/test_ccs_canonical.py (which is the canon-derived
half of G7 for the envelope/continuity domain, canon section 12).

This file closes G7 completely: with the envelope domain covered by
test_ccs_canonical.py and the evaluator domain covered here, the
project's canonical invariants (AC^3, T^26, and the manifest layer)
each have tests whose lineage runs from the canon to the assertion,
not from the code. A reader of canon section 11 can verify that
evaluator.py honors the canonical authority, coverage, and manifest
invariants by reading this file's docstrings against CANON/canon.md,
without having to read evaluator.py itself.

These tests exercise the predicate functions directly
(ac3_valid, t26_valid, manifest_integrity_valid) rather than the
end-to-end evaluate() pipeline. This is deliberate and is the
different-shape complement to the 23 code-derived tests in
TESTS/test_adversarial_evaluator.py (which drive evaluate()
end-to-end): canon section 11 defines AC^3 (11.7), T^26 (11.8), and
the governing manifest (11.9) as separate clauses, so the
canon-derived tests isolate one predicate per assertion to mirror
that per-clause structure. Per VL-034 Decision D, the code-derived
suite is augmented, not replaced.

Canon-citation set (Lesson 5 set-exhaustiveness, enumerated against
CANON/canon.md sections 11 and 9 at session start, source-first):

  AC^3 -- canon 11.7 "AC^3(I) = 1 <=> AP(I) superset-or-equal AR(I)"
    (with canon 11.5 "Present Authorities AP(I)", canon 11.3
    "Required Authorities AR(I)", canon section 3 "all required
    authority must be present"):
      - equality case of superset-or-equal        -> test_ac3_ap_equals_ar_accepts
      - proper-superset case                       -> test_ac3_ap_proper_superset_accepts
      - not-a-superset                             -> test_ac3_ap_missing_required_rejects
      - empty AP against non-empty AR              -> test_ac3_empty_ap_nonempty_ar_rejects
      - order independence of the set relation     -> test_ac3_order_independence
      - vacuous superset of the empty AR           -> test_ac3_empty_ar_accepts_any_ap
      - set membership ignores duplicates          -> test_ac3_duplicate_ap_members_ignored
      - fail-closed on malformed AP (canon 9)      -> test_ac3_type_violation_fails_closed

  T^26 -- canon 11.8 "T^26(I) = 1 <=> OP(I) superset-or-equal R(I)"
    (with canon 11.6 "Observed Coverage OP(I)", canon 11.4 "Coverage
    Requirements R(I)", canon section 3 "all required participants,
    roles, and evidence must be present"): same eight shapes over
    OP/R -> test_t26_* (mirrors the AC^3 enumeration).

  Manifest integrity -- canon 11.9 "the manifest must be
    deterministic, versioned, and integrity-verifiable", with canon
    12.4 "governing manifest version change" as an explicit invalid
    transition, and canon section 9 "fail closed under any missing or
    invalid input conditions":
      - both pins match (versioned)                -> test_manifest_version_pin_match_passes
      - version pin mismatch (12.4)                -> test_manifest_version_pin_mismatch_rejects
      - version pin missing (canon 9)              -> test_manifest_version_pin_missing_fails_closed
      - both pins match (integrity-verifiable)     -> test_manifest_sha256_pin_match_passes
      - sha256 pin mismatch (11.9 + 12.4)          -> test_manifest_sha256_pin_mismatch_rejects
      - sha256 pin missing (canon 9)               -> test_manifest_sha256_pin_missing_fails_closed

Artifact-05-layer acknowledgment (VL-034 Decision C, per VL-028
Decision B precedent): canon section 11 defines AC^3/T^26 as pure set
relations and defines the manifest's required PROPERTIES (11.9), but
does not specify the wire-level coercion or the caller-pinning
mechanism. Three test groups therefore carry an explicit
artifact-05-layer acknowledgment in their docstrings rather than a
bare canon citation:

  - test_ac3_duplicate_ap_members_ignored and
    test_t26_duplicate_op_members_ignored: canon 11.5/11.6 name AP/OP
    as SETS (so duplicates are not a canonical concept); the
    list-to-set coercion that realizes this is safe_set() in code --
    artifact-05-layer mechanism, canon set-semantics basis.
  - test_ac3_type_violation_fails_closed and
    test_t26_type_violation_fails_closed: canon section 9 directly
    authorizes fail-closed behavior; the SPECIFIC coercion
    (safe_set() returning None on a non-list-of-str, which the
    predicate maps to False) is artifact-05-layer.
  - the entire manifest-integrity group: canon 11.9 specifies the
    manifest's properties; the caller-pinning check
    (expected_manifest_version / expected_manifest_sha256 asserted by
    the caller and compared against the loaded manifest) is the
    artifact-05-layer mechanism described in
    docs/restructure/05_admissibility_envelope_spec.md. Citation is
    therefore canon-11.9-via-artifact-05.

G11 note (VL-034 Decision F, B-park): manifest_sha256() ignores its
optional path argument and always hashes the on-disk MANIFEST_PATH.
So manifest_integrity_valid() reads the version from its `manifest`
argument but reads the sha256 from disk -- a manifest-source
asymmetry tracked as G11 in
docs/restructure/04_current_vs_claimed.md (bookkeeping batch). These
tests use manifest_integrity_valid()'s actual behavior (live disk
hash via manifest_sha256()); G11 is documented here but is NOT made a
test obligation in this suite. Per VL-034 constraint (i), no test
pins a literal hash VALUE: the expected sha is derived live from
manifest_sha256() so the suite survives a GR-1 canon/manifest-version
event without edits.

Ledger: VL-034 (canon-derived tests for the evaluator domain; G7
complete).
