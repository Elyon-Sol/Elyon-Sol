"""
Canon-derived tests for IMPLEMENTATION/envelope.py.

Each test cites a specific clause of CANON/canon.md (whitepaper
v0.9.8.4) in its docstring and verifies envelope.py's behavior
against that clause. Companion file
TESTS/adversarial/test_envelope.py is spec-derived (cites
docs/restructure/05_admissibility_envelope_spec.md).

This file is the G7 partial-closure signal for the envelope domain:
tests derived from the canon, not from the code. A reader of
canon section 12 can verify that envelope.py honors the canonical
CCS invariant by reading this file's docstrings against
CANON/canon.md, without having to read envelope.py itself.

Per VL-028 session opener constraint (e): "Each test's docstring
quotes or paraphrases a specific canon section 12 clause (or, for
Row 2 per Decision B, the post-VL-026 spec's Row 2 Canon basis
wording). The Bundle B verifier-runs' per-branch citations
[recorded in EVIDENCE/verification_ledger.md VL-025 follow-up] are
the authoritative starting point but each test docstring must
still cite the canon clause directly, not the verifier-run by
reference."

Canon-citation set (Lesson 5 set-exhaustiveness, enumerated
against the VL-025 follow-up Bundle B verifier-runs and verified
against CANON/canon.md):

  - canon 12.1 "state transition S_t -> S_{t+1}" -> test 1
  - canon 12.3 "continuity constraint; d_{t+1} = u_{t+1} AND
    c_{t+1}" -> test 2 (first-issuance None); xfail tests 1 and 2
    (forward-looking derivation rule on REASSERTED)
  - canon 12.4 "failure condition; if any condition is violated:
    CCS = 0; governing manifest version change / role or authority
    schema change as invalid transitions" -> test 3 (evaluator
    change); xfail tests 2 and 3 (forward-looking derivation rule
    on INVALIDATED / RE-EVALUATE-REQUIRED)
  - canon 11.9 "the manifest must be deterministic, versioned, and
    integrity-verifiable" -> test 4 (manifest change), jointly with
    canon 12.4
  - canon 13 "Eligibility does not persist across state transitions
    without revalidation" -> test 5

Row 2 (decision_sha256 verification -> INVALIDATED) is included
per VL-028 opener Decision B with an explicit artifact-05-layer
acknowledgment in the docstring -- canon section 12.3/12.4
authorize the fail-closed semantics; the specific tamper-detection
mechanism is artifact-05-layer per post-VL-026 Edit 4.

xfail tests (per VL-028 opener Decision A and constraint (k)):
the post-VL-026 spec's forward-looking ccs-derivation rule
(Open question 1 resolution) is not implemented by envelope.py
at HEAD. reassert() at VL-025 returns a bare string outcome; the
xfail tests assert against a post-VL-029 dict-shaped return
{"outcome": ..., "ccs": ...}. The dict shape is provisional;
VL-029 may select a tuple, a companion function, or another
shape. strict=True makes the xfail an honest signal: if the
tests xpass, envelope.py has been updated and the test shape
must be reconciled with VL-029's actual interface choice in the
same commit.

Ledger: VL-028 (proposed; canon-derived half of G7 envelope-domain
partial closure).
